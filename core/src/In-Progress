==Important Info==
> New enum ClassName attribute in each class to be used to refer to the class as a whole
> Use Actions for simple actor manipulation

==Bugs==
> Sometimes portals won't spawn after killing all enemies.
> Alpha cannot be manipulated properly -> we are most likely drawing actors without their alpha property

 (like BigSlime),can allow the Enemy to have different options
 - Changed Collisions class to invoke hitAction() instead of remove() method on enemies
