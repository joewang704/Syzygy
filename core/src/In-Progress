Standing on homeportal when killing boss immediately returns to main screen.


Done:
 - Made a BigSlime enemy class that, when hit, spawns four slimes in its place.
 - Changed Enemy class to have a hitAction() method, which for most enemies is remove but for specific enemies
 (like BigSlime),can allow the Enemy to have different options
 - Changed Collisions class to invoke hitAction() instead of remove() method on enemies
 - Changed RoomScreen class to include BigSlime as a third enemy(changed random generator, made
   spawnBigSlime() method)
